# Versitron Electric Substation Fiber Converter

The **Versitron Electric Substation Fiber Converter** is purpose-built to deliver secure, interference-free data transmission for power generation, distribution, and substation automation systems. Designed to withstand the extreme electrical noise and environmental challenges common in substations, this converter transforms copper-based Ethernet or serial signals into fiber optic transmission, ensuring reliable long-distance connectivity.

## Product Overview

Electric substations demand high reliability and immunity to electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by high-voltage equipment. The Versitron fiber converter solves these challenges by replacing vulnerable copper links with fiber optic cabling, providing galvanic isolation and preventing data corruption.

With industrial-grade components, extended temperature range, and a rugged metal enclosure, it is ideal for mission-critical applications such as SCADA system connectivity, relay control networking, and substation monitoring. The converter supports multimode or singlemode fiber to meet a variety of distance and performance needs.

## Key Features

- **EMI/RFI Immunity**: Fiber optics eliminate interference from high-voltage equipment.
- **Long-Distance Transmission**: Extend data communication up to 80 km over singlemode fiber.
- **Copper-to-Fiber Conversion**: Supports Ethernet or serial interfaces (model dependent).
- **Rugged Industrial Design**: Operates in harsh conditions with high durability.
- **Wide Temperature Range**: Reliable performance from -40°C to +75°C.
- **Plug-and-Play Operation**: Easy setup with auto-negotiation for speed and duplex.
- **Flexible Mounting**: DIN-rail or wall-mountable for versatile deployment.
- **Power Redundancy**: AC or DC power input options for uninterrupted operation.

## Applications

- **SCADA Communication Links**: Secure data transfer between control rooms and field devices.
- **Relay Protection Systems**: Reliable fiber backbone for high-speed relay signaling.
